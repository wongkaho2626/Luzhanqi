Luzhanqi (Chinese: 陆战棋, “Land Battle Chess”) is a two-player Chinese board game (demo video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUhfxclysZU). It is a non-perfect abstract strategy game of partial information, since each player has only limited knowledge concerning the disposition of the opposing pieces. A reference can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luzhanqi. You are asked to implement this game for 2 players with the following requirements:

• Include a README page to describe the rules of the game which you decide to adopt.

• One player of the game is your program. You may choose not to include any intelligence or heuristics in the program for the winning of the game.

• A user starts the game by clicking a START button and quit the game by clicking the STOP button.

• For each step/move, there is a time limit which a user can set.
